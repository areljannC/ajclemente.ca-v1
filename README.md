# ajclemente.ca | Web Portfolio
After so many sketches, iterations and re-coded portfolios that I have done in the past, I am happy to say that this is my web portfolio built with React.js.

## Built With
* **React.js** - create-react-app
* **React Pose** - component animation
* **React Scroll** - smooth-mouse scrolling
* **Formik** - React forms made simple
* **Yup** - form validation
* **Axios** - handle HTTP requests for forms 
* **Bulma** - my current favourite CSS framework
* **SASS** - customizing Bulma and other CSS stuff made simple
* **Visual Studio Code** - my text-editor of choice powered by awesome extensions and sleek themes

This portfolio was a great learning experience for me because I got to finally learn and use this framework that everyone is raving about... **React.js**.

Developing this with all the technologies used above took roughly a week which mostly consisted of reading documentation and designing the entire page on Adobe XD. 

I would have to say that executing / coding this took only about 20% of that week. 

The key lesson here is to **READ, READ, READ THE DOCS**.

## Design
* **Adobe XD** - quick webpage design and mockups
* **Adobe Photoshop** - used to make that simple *AJ* logo for the site
* **Coolors.co** - choosing color palettes made easy (*I highly recommend [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) for those struggling with color designs*)

## Acknowledgements
I'd like to thank Google and the documentation made for the libraries and modules I used for this project. Without these people, I would probably be lost in the realm of modern web development. 

I'd also like to thank my stubborn self for finally integrating version control as a part of my development setup instead of using Google Drive.

After using Git with this project, my favourite poetic line of 2019 so far is **git push**.

(*Seriously, what a feeling it is when you are done with the code and all that is left is to **git push**.*)
